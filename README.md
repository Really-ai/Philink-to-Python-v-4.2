# Philink-to-Python-v-4.2
The main brainchild and operator of the Philink Bussiness I started, which operated from January 21, 2017 to April 29, 2020. As of March 13, 2021, the 20 computers the bussiness generated (worth approximately 20k php each), are still functional but is no longer managed by the Philink Futurepath Algorithm.


To run the program, simply open program.py with Python 3, or you can view the data and other algorithms in PhilinkToPython 4.22.xlsx.
